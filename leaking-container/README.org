* Simulation of container with a hole

You can place the hole anywhere, just change the elevation.

Change the parameters in the config file to run different simulations. make sure all datatypes are in float. 

** How to run
first compile the program with ~make~ command or ~gcc container.c~, in second case you need to point it to the libraries' header files. The libraries used and their flags are:

| Library | Flag     |
|---------+----------|
| Math    | -lm      |
| Config  | -lconfig |
| SDL2    | -lSDL2   |

This information can also be understood by reading the ~Makefile~.

Now you can run your compiled program. Running without any argument will give you help menu. you just need to pass the config file as argument. A sample config file ~conf1.conf~ is given. 

Run the program with that config file with the command ~./container conf1.conf~. 

You can see something like this window.

The size of the screen and offset can be changed by changing the macros on ~container.c~.

** Plotting the output
Currently I don't have plot inside the program itself but you can extract the output of standard output and then plot it. For example, pipe the output to a file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./container conf1.conf > data.dat
#+END_SRC

Then You'll have data.dat with space delimited file with ~time~, ~height~ & ~discharge~. You can now use any plotting program to plot the output. I prefer ~gnuplot~. 

The following code in gnuplot can plot the file. 
#+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot
set ytics nomirror
set y2tics
plot "data.dat" using 1:2 with lines title "Height",\
     "" using 1:3 with lines axis x1y2 title "Discharge"
#+END_SRC

The following plot can be seen.
