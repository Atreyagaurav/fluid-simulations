* Fluid Simulation - Dam breaking
The codes for the simulation are from [[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/class/cs5220-f11/code/sph.pdf][cornell uni resources]] I found online. 
I modified slightly and then coded a visualizer. you can find how to run with ~-h~ flag.


** Usage 

*** Build the file
Use the ~make~ command to build the executables.
 
*** Simulate
Use the config file like in the given example to run simulations, you can have multiple config files just pass the config file with ~-c~ flag to the simulate program. 

*** Visualize
the usage for visualize program is ~./visualize OUTFILE~ where OUTFILE is the simulation output generated from the simulate program. 


Here is an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts9d5zTF27E][Example simulation video]] made from this program.
